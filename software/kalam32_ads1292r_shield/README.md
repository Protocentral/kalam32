ADS1292R Example Code for Kalam32
====================

This project is code for the [ProtoCentral Kalam32-DEV IoT development board](https://www.protocentral.com/kalam-iot/1156-protocentral-kalam32-dev-esp32-wi-fi-and-bluetooth-iot-platform.html) working as a TCP server and interfacing with the [ADS1292R ECG/Respiration Shield](https://www.protocentral.com/biomedical-shields/818-ads1292r-ecgrespiration-shield-v2.html). This demonstrates the use of the Kalam32 for simple connected applications.
